Materials for Stata Tutorials of Empirical Evaluation of Economic Policy course at Universit√§t Hamburg (2024).

The folder **Materials** contains a subfolder for each of the four tutorials. Each subfolder **TutorialX_Topic** consists of three things:

1. A pdf with the excercises to be covered during the tutorial. This document also contains a summary of the main theoretical concepts.
2. A pdf of the paper on which the application in the tutorial is based.
3. A Stata data set to be used during the tutorial (.dta file).

After each tutorial, I will upload the solutions in the relevant subfolder (.do file).
